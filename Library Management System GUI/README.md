## Library Management System

This is a lecture exercise for the wonderful python student at LOCTECH. It is the demo of how to use Python to build a GUI Graphical User In terface. Here we built a software the can add, read, update and delete (The `CRUD` operation) book from the database.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and tkinter installed on their local machines.

Our tech stack will include the following:

- **sqlite3** as a tool to connect with our database and perform SQL Query
- **SQLite** as our database of choice
